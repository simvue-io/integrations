MOOSE Connector Example
========================
This is an example of the MOOSERun Connector class.

The MOOSE simulation used here simulated the diffusion of heat through
a rectangular bar, where one end is held at 0K, and the other end at 1000K.

To run this example with Docker:
    - Pull the base MOOSE image: docker run -it idaholab/moose:latest
    - Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/simvue-io/integrations.git
    - Move into MOOSE examples directory: cd integrations/examples/moose
    - Create a simvue.toml file, copying in your information from the Simvue server: vi simvue.toml
    - Install Poetry: pip install poetry
    - Install required modules: poetry install
    - Run the example script: poetry run python moose_example.py

To run this example on your own system with MOOSE installed:
    - Ensure that you have a MOOSE app installed with the Heat Transfer module enabled
    - Move into MOOSE examples directory: cd integrations/examples/moose
    - Create a simvue.toml file, copying in your information from the Simvue server: vi simvue.toml
    - Update the 'MOOSE_APP_PATH' at the top of the script to point to your MOOSE app
    - Install Poetry: pip install poetry
    - Install required modules: poetry install
    - Run the example script: poetry run python moose_example.py
